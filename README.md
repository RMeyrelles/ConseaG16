# ConseaG16
Confromation Search using Gaussian 16 and CREST.

Computational chemistry workflow to perform conformational search, followed by quantum chemical calculations for reaction profiles. 

Series of scripts in bash should be run in sequence for a step-by step search of the most stable conformer from a set of .xyz coordinates.

Each script contains additional funtion details
